CARET(1)                         User Commands                        CARET(1)

NAME
       caret - orchestrate and interact with Caret AI coding agents

SYNOPSIS
       caret [prompt] [options]

       caret command [subcommand] [options] [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       Try: cat README.md | caret "Summarize this for me:"

       caret is a command-line interface for orchestrating multiple Caret AI
       coding agents.  Caret is an autonomous AI agent who can read, write,
       and execute code across your projects.  He operates through a
       client-server architecture where Caret Core runs as a standalone
       service, and the CLI acts as a scriptable interface for managing tasks,
       instances, and agent interactions.

       The CLI is designed for both interactive use and automation, making it
       ideal for CI/CD pipelines, parallel task execution, and terminal-based
       workflows.  Multiple frontends (CLI, VSCode, JetBrains) can attach to
       the same Caret Core instance, enabling seamless task handoff between
       environments.

MODES OF OPERATION
       Instant Task Mode
              The simplest invocation: caret "prompt here" immediately spawns
              an instance, creates a task, and enters chat mode.  This is
              equivalent to running caret instance new && caret task new &&
              caret task chat in sequence.

       Subcommand Mode
              Advanced usage with explicit control: caret <command>
              [subcommand] [options] provides fine-grained control over
              instances, tasks, authentication, and configuration.

AGENT BEHAVIOR
       Caret operates in two primary modes:

       ACT MODE
              Caret actively uses tools to accomplish tasks.  He can read
              files, write code, execute commands, use a headless browser, and
              more.  This is the default mode for task execution.

       PLAN MODE
              Caret gathers information and creates a detailed plan before
              implementation.  He explores the codebase, asks clarifying
              questions, and presents a strategy for user approval before
              switching to ACT MODE.

INSTANT TASK OPTIONS
       When using the instant task syntax caret "prompt" the following options
       are available:

       -o, --oneshot
              Full autonomous mode.  Caret completes the task and stops
              following after completion.  Example: caret -o "what's 6 + 8?"

       -s, --setting setting value
              Override a setting for this task

       -y, --no-interactive, --yolo
              Enable fully autonomous mode.  Disables all interactivity:

              • ask_followup_question tool is disabled

              • attempt_completion happens automatically

              • execute_command runs in non-blocking mode with timeout

              • PLAN MODE automatically switches to ACT MODE

       -m, --mode mode
              Starting mode.  Options: act (default), plan

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       These options apply to all subcommands:

       -F, --output-format format
              Output format.  Options: rich (default), json, plain

       -h, --help
              Display help information for the command.

       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose output for debugging.

COMMANDS
   Authentication
       caret auth [provider] [key]

       caret a [provider] [key]
              Configure authentication for AI model providers.  Launches an
              interactive wizard if no arguments provided.  If provider is
              specified without a key, prompts for the key or launches the
              appropriate OAuth flow.

   Instance Management
       Caret Core instances are independent agent processes that can run in
       the background.  Multiple instances can run simultaneously, enabling
       parallel task execution.

       caret instance

       caret i
              Display instance management help.

       caret instance new [-d|--default]

       caret i n [-d|--default]
              Spawn a new Caret Core instance.  Use --default to set it as
              the default instance for subsequent commands.

       caret instance list

       caret i l
              List all running Caret Core instances with their addresses and
              status.

       caret instance default address

       caret i d address
              Set the default instance to avoid specifying --address in task
              commands.

       caret instance kill address [-a|--all]

       caret i k address [-a|--all]
              Terminate a Caret Core instance.  Use --all to kill all running
              instances.

   Task Management
       Tasks represent individual work items that Caret executes.  Tasks
       maintain conversation history, checkpoints, and settings.

       caret task [-a|--address ADDR]

       caret t [-a|--address ADDR]
              Display task management help.  The --address flag specifies
              which Caret Core instance to use (e.g., localhost:50052).

       caret task new prompt [options]

       caret t n prompt [options]
              Create a new task in the default or specified instance.
              Options:

              -s, --setting setting value
                     Set task-specific settings

              -y, --no-interactive, --yolo
                     Enable autonomous mode

              -m, --mode mode
                     Starting mode (act or plan)

       caret task open task-id [options]

       caret t o task-id [options]
              Resume a previous task from history.  Accepts the same options
              as task new.

       caret task list

       caret t l
              List all tasks in history with their id and snippet

       caret task chat

       caret t c
              Enter interactive chat mode for the current task.  Allows
              back-and-forth conversation with Caret.

       caret task send [message] [options]

       caret t s [message] [options]
              Send a message to Caret.  If no message is provided, reads from
              stdin.  Options:

              -a, --approve
                     Approve Caret's proposed action

                     Switch mode (act or plan)

       caret task view [-f|--follow] [-c|--follow-complete]

       caret t v [-f|--follow] [-c|--follow-complete]
              Display the current conversation.  Use --follow to stream
              updates in real-time, or --follow-complete to follow until task
              completion.

       caret task restore checkpoint

       caret t r checkpoint
              Restore the task to a previous checkpoint state.

       caret task pause

       caret t p
              Pause task execution.

   Configuration

TASK SETTINGS
       Task settings are persisted in the ~/.caret/x/tasks directory.  When
       resuming a task with caret task open, task settings are automatically
       restored.

       Common settings include:

       yolo   Enable autonomous mode (true/false)

       mode   Starting mode (act/plan)

NOTES & EXAMPLES
       The caret task send and caret task new commands support reading from
       stdin, enabling powerful pipeline compositions:

              cat requirements.txt | caret task send
              echo "Refactor this code" | caret -y

   Instance Management
       Manage multiple Caret instances:

              # Start a new instance and make it default
              caret instance new --default

              # List all running instances
              caret instance list

              # Kill a specific instance
              caret instance kill localhost:50052

              # Kill all CLI instances
              caret instance kill --all-cli

   Task History
       Work with task history:

              # List previous tasks
              caret task list

              # Resume a previous task
              caret task open 1760501486669

              # View conversation history
              caret task view

              # Start interactive chat with this task
              caret task chat

ARCHITECTURE
       Caret operates on a three-layer architecture:

       Presentation Layer
              User interfaces (CLI, VSCode, JetBrains) that connect to Caret
              Core via gRPC

       Caret Core
              The autonomous agent service handling task management, AI model
              integration, state management, tool orchestration, and real-time
              streaming updates

       Host Provider Layer
              Environment-specific integrations (VSCode APIs, JetBrains APIs,
              shell APIs) that Caret Core uses to interact with the host
              system
