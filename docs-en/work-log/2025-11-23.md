# Work Log — 2025-11-23

## Summary
- Added contributor guidance (`AGENTS.md`) tailored to the repo and noted Korean usage rules; seeded the work-log template for ongoing tracking.
- No builds/tests executed yet; next step is team review of the new docs.

## Completed
- [x] Created `AGENTS.md` with project structure, commands, style, testing, PR guidance, and security tips.
- [x] Added 한국어 안내 section to `AGENTS.md` (English default, Korean allowed with English summary; logs can stay in source language).
- [x] Added work-log template at `docs/work-log/2025-11-23.md` for daily tracking.
- [x] Drafted plan `docs/work-log/2025-11-23-plan.md` and applied it: added caret note to `docs/caret-cli/overview.mdx`, created merge playbook `docs/merging/update-strategy.mdx`, and linked it in `docs/docs.json`.
- [x] Documented upstream vs caret doc delta `docs/merging/caret-diff-summary-2025-11-23.md` and updated strategy to include caret-only policy notes.
- [x] Added caret alignment note to `docs/introduction/overview.mdx` to flag caret-specific policies where needed.
- [x] Added repeatable update guide `docs/merging/caret-docs-playbook.mdx` and linked it in `docs/docs.json`.
- [x] Added caret policy notes to key pages: `docs/getting-started/installing-caret.mdx`, `docs/provider-config/anthropic.mdx`, `docs/features/multiroot-workspace.mdx`, `docs/features/tasks/understanding-tasks.mdx`, `docs/features/customization/opening-caret-in-sidebar.mdx`.
- [x] Created master plan `docs/merging/master-update-plan.md` consolidating purpose, scope, policy placeholders, and next actions.
- [x] Added caret policy notes to additional pages: `docs/getting-started/selecting-your-model.mdx`, `docs/model-config/model-comparison.mdx`, `docs/running-models-locally/overview.mdx`, `docs/provider-config/openai.mdx`.
- [x] Added caret policy notes broadly: `docs/getting-started/your-first-project.mdx`, `docs/model-config/context-windows.mdx`, `docs/provider-config/claude-code.mdx`, `docs/provider-config/cerebras.mdx`, `docs/provider-config/openrouter.mdx`, `docs/provider-config/mistral-ai.mdx`, `docs/provider-config/baseten.mdx`, `docs/running-models-locally/lm-studio.mdx`, `docs/running-models-locally/ollama.mdx`, `docs/features/caret-rules.mdx`, `docs/features/hooks.mdx`, `docs/features/dictation.mdx`, `docs/enterprise-solutions/overview.mdx`, `docs/enterprise-solutions/security-concerns.mdx`, `docs/more-info/telemetry.mdx`.

## In Progress
- [ ] Awaiting feedback on `AGENTS.md`, language guidelines, and new merge/update strategy doc.
- [ ] Need to apply remaining MDX diffs (onboarding, providers, models, features) with caret-specific notes where applicable.

## Blockers / Risks
- None noted.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Share `AGENTS.md` with maintainers for review/edits (ETA: next workday).
- [ ] Run `npm run check-types` and `npm run lint` once doc changes are approved to ensure repo health (owner: dev team).
- [ ] Decide if additional MDX diffs from `caret-latest` need follow-up passes (onboarding, provider configs, etc.).
- [ ] Add caret-only notes (model gating, auth/routing) once confirmed; align branding across onboarding/CLI/provider docs.
- [ ] Continue applying `caret-diff-summary` items (onboarding, providers, features) with caret notes.
- [ ] Run docs preview after bulk MDX updates to verify links/anchors.
- [ ] Populate caret-specific policy placeholders (model support/blocks, auth/routing, telemetry) in master plan and per-page notes.

## Notes
- Consider adding links to key scripts (e.g., `scripts/build-proto.mjs`, `scripts/build-cli.sh`) in `AGENTS.md` if reviewers want deeper references.
