## Running Local Models with Caret: What You Need to Know

Cline is a powerful AI coding assistant that uses tool calls to help you write, analyze, and modify code. Running models locally can save API costs, but there are important trade-offs. Local models are far less reliable at using the essential tools that make Cline effective.

## Why Local Models Are Different

When you run a "local version" of a model, you're actually running a heavily simplified copy of the original. This process--called distillation--is like compressing a master chef's knowledge into a basic cookbook. You keep simple recipes but lose complex techniques and intuition.

Local models are trained to mimic larger ones, but typically retain only about 1-26% of the original model's capacity. That massive reduction means:

-   Reduced ability to understand complex context
-   Weaker multi-step reasoning
-   Limited tool use
-   Simplified decision-making

Think of it like running your development environment on a calculator instead of a computer. Basic tasks may work, but complex tasks become unreliable or impossible.

### What Actually Happens

When running local models with Cline:

#### Performance Impact

-   Responses are 5-10x slower than cloud services.
-   System resources (CPU, GPU, RAM) are heavily used.
-   Your computer may become less responsive for other tasks.

#### Tool Reliability Issues

-   Code analysis is less accurate.
-   File operations may be unreliable.
-   Browser automation is reduced.
-   Terminal commands fail more often.
-   Complex multi-step tasks often break.

### Hardware Requirements

At minimum, you'll need:

-   A modern GPU with 8GB+ VRAM and AVX2 support (RTX 3070 or higher)
-   32GB+ system RAM
-   Fast SSD storage
-   Good cooling

Even with this hardware, you're still running a smaller, less capable version of the model.

| Model Size | What You Get |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 7B model | Basic coding, limited tool use |
| 14B model | Better coding, unstable tool use |
| 32B model | Good coding, inconsistent tool use |
| 70B model | Best local performance, expensive hardware required |

In short, the cloud (API) versions are the full models. For example, the full DeepSeek-R1 model is 671B. Distilled local models are inherently "diluted" versions of the cloud models.

### Practical Recommendations

#### Consider This Approach

1. Use cloud models for:
    - Complex development work
    - Tasks where tool reliability matters
    - Multi-step tasks
    - Critical code changes
2. Use local models for:
    - Simple code completion
    - Basic documentation
    - Cases where privacy is the top priority
    - Learning and experimentation

#### If You Must Go Local

-   Start with smaller models
-   Keep tasks simple and focused
-   Save work frequently
-   Be ready to switch to cloud models for complex tasks
-   Monitor system resources

### Common Issues

-   **"Tool execution failed"**: Local models struggle with complex tool chains. Simplify your prompts.
-   **"The target machine actively refused the connection"**: This usually means Ollama or LM Studio isn't running, or it's on a different port/address than configured in Cline. Double-check the Base URL in API provider settings.
-   **"There's a problem with Cline..."**: Increase the model's context length to the maximum.
-   **Slow or incomplete responses:** Local models are often slower than cloud models, especially on weaker hardware. Try smaller models and expect much longer processing times.
-   **System stability:** Watch GPU/CPU usage and temperatures.
-   **Context limits:** Local models often have smaller context windows than cloud models. Break work into smaller chunks.

### Looking Ahead

Local model capabilities are improving, but they still cannot fully replace cloud services--especially for Cline's tool-based features. Carefully evaluate your requirements and hardware before committing to a local-only setup.
