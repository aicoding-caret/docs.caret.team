# ^ AI Organization Knowledge & Rules Standardization

<BrandName /> is designed so that AI **accurately understands and follows your team's coding rules and standards**. Through this system, AI functions as a true team member that understands project context, not just a simple code generation tool.

## Why Is Knowledge Synchronization Important?

| Situation | Generic AI Tools | <BrandName /> |
|---|---|---|
| **Team Rule Compliance** | Doesn't know rules | ✅ Automatically recognizes rule files |
| **Project Context** | Needs explanation every time | ✅ Persistent memory |
| **Code Consistency** | Different styles per tool | ✅ Maintains team standards |
| **Role Optimization** | None | ✅ Separate AI/Human documents |

## Core Concept 1: Dual Directory Architecture

<BrandName /> acknowledges that **documents for AI and humans serve different purposes**. To address this, it uses two directories:

```
your-project/
├── .agents/                    # For AI (English, token-optimized)
│   ├── context/               # System rules
│   │   ├── agents-rules.json  # Main rules file (SoT)
│   │   └── ai-work-index.yaml # Work index
│   ├── workflows/             # Task workflows
│   │   └── atoms/             # Reusable building blocks
│   ├── skills/                # AI skills
│   └── hooks/                 # Event hooks
│
├── .users/                     # For humans (native language, detailed)
│   ├── context/               # Project context (Markdown)
│   ├── workflows/             # Workflow guides
│   └── skills/                # Skill guides
│
└── AGENTS.md                   # AI entry point
```

### Why Separate?

| Category | `.agents/` (For AI) | `.users/` (For Humans) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Language** | English (token efficient) | Native language |
| **Format** | JSON/YAML (structured) | Markdown (readable) |
| **Purpose** | Ensure deterministic behavior | Provide detailed explanations |
| **Target** | AI agents | Developers/Team members |

**Token Optimization**: Files in `.agents/` are written in English to convey the same meaning with fewer tokens. This efficiently uses the context window and reduces costs.

## Core Concept 2: Atomic Knowledge System

<BrandName /> uses an **Atomic Knowledge** approach. Instead of a single massive document, knowledge is broken into minimal units (Atoms) and combined as needed.

### How It Works

1. **Task Analysis**: AI reads `ai-work-index.yaml` to identify the task type
2. **Workflow Loading**: Only reads the relevant workflow file
3. **Knowledge Atom Composition**: Loads only the atoms referenced by the workflow
4. **Task Execution**: Performs the task with combined knowledge

### Example

```
.agents/workflows/
├── code-review.md             # Code review workflow
├── feature-implementation.md  # Feature implementation workflow
└── atoms/                     # Reusable building blocks
    ├── tdd-cycle.md           # TDD cycle
    ├── naming-conventions.md  # Naming conventions
    └── document-changes.md    # Documenting changes
```

**Benefit**: Instead of always loading all rules, AI selectively loads only the rules needed for the current task, **saving tokens**.

## Core Concept 3: Rule Location & Priority

<BrandName /> uses the **`.agents/context/`** folder as the single source of rules. This ensures AI follows consistent standards across the entire project.

### Rule Locations

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|------|------|
| **Workspace Rules** | `.agents/context/` | Project-specific rules |
| **Directory Scope** | `AGENTS.md` | Apply to specific folders only |
| **Global Rules** | `Documents/Careti/Rules` | Apply to all projects |
| **Workflows** | `.agents/workflows/` | On-demand loading |

### Why Is Standardization Important?

| Problem | Solution |
|------|------|
| Rules scattered in multiple places | Manage in one place |
| Rule conflicts occur | Clear priority order |
| AI misses rules | Guaranteed automatic loading |

## Core Concept 4: Cross-Organization Knowledge Sync

Using submodules, you can **share rules and knowledge across multiple projects** throughout your organization.

### Organization Repository Pattern

```
org-context/                      # Organization shared repository (Git)
├── .agents/                      # AI context
│   ├── context/                  # Organization rules/policies
│   │   ├── conventions.md        # Development conventions
│   │   ├── tech-stack.md         # Tech stack
│   │   └── security-policy.md    # Security policy
│   └── workflows/                # Workflow definitions
│       ├── code-review.md
│       └── release-process.md
│
├── .users/                       # User documentation (mirrored)
│   ├── context/
│   │   ├── dev-standards.md      # Detailed guide
│   │   └── tech-stack.md
│   └── workflows/
│       └── code-review-guide.md
│
└── AGENTS.md                     # Organization AI entry point
```

### Connecting as Submodule

```bash
# Add organization context as submodule
git submodule add git@github.com:your-org/org-context.git
```

```
your-project/
├── .agents/                # Project rules
├── .users/                 # Project user documentation
├── org-context/            # ← Submodule (organization rules)
│   ├── .agents/
│   └── .users/
└── AGENTS.md
```

### 4-Layer Rule Merging

```
Layer 1: Global (User-wide)
    ~/.agents/                    # Personal AI rules

Layer 2: Organization
    org-context/.agents/          # Organization AI context

Layer 3: Project
    {project}/.agents/            # Project AI rules

Layer 4: Local (Per-directory)
    {project}/packages/{pkg}/
    └── AGENTS.md                 # Per-directory override

Merge Priority: Local > Project > Organization > Global
```

### Use Cases

```bash
# All tasks possible in one project:

# Coding task
"Refactor this function"
→ References .agents/context/ rules for the task

# Company policy question
"What's the remote work policy?"
→ Reads org-context/.users/policies/remote-work.md and answers

# Workflow guide
"How do I do code review?"
→ References org-context/.users/workflows/code-review-guide.md
```

## Quick Start: `/init` Command

If your project doesn't have the standard structure, you can auto-generate it with the `/init` command.

```bash
# In Careti chat
/init
```

This command:
- Creates `.agents/` and `.users/` folder structure
- Provides default rule templates
- **Never overwrites existing files** (safe)

## Migrating Existing Projects

If you have rule files in other locations, move them to `.agents/context/`.

```
your-project/
├── .agents/
│   ├── context/          # Rule files
│   │   └── coding.md     # e.g., Coding standards
│   └── workflows/        # Workflows (optional)
└── AGENTS.md             # Root instructions (optional)
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. True Partnership
AI and developers communicate based on the same documents, eliminating misunderstandings.

### 2. Token Efficiency
- Save tokens with English-written `.agents/` files
- On-Demand Loading loads only necessary rules

### 3. Organization-Wide Consistency
All projects share the same organization rules through submodules.

### 4. Transparency
Developers can clearly see how AI works through the `.agents/` folder.

### 5. Team Consistency
- All team members use the same rules
- AI reliability - never misses rules
- Version control - track rule change history
- Flexible scope - choose project/folder/global
