# Caret Provider

Caret Provider is an integrated authentication system that allows you to use an AI coding assistant immediately without an API key. It is currently under development and will be released soon.

## What is it?

The first barrier many developers face when using Caret for the first time is API key setup. The process of obtaining API keys from AI providers like OpenAI or Anthropic, registering payment information, and managing usage can be cumbersome.

Caret Provider removes this initial entry barrier. With just a Caret account, you can immediately use the AI assistant without separate API key configuration.

## Google Gemini Priority Support

The first supported model for Caret Provider will be **Google Gemini**. Gemini offers powerful coding capabilities while being relatively affordable, making it suitable for beginners and individual developers.

## Free Credits

All users who use Caret Provider for the first time will receive **free credits**. This allows you to thoroughly test Caret's features without actual cost burden.

## Future Plans

After Gemini support, we plan to add other AI models sequentially so they can be used through Caret Provider.

## Release Notification

When the release of Caret Provider is imminent, we will announce through the following channels:

- Notifications within Caret VS Code extension
- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/caret)
- Official website (https://caret.team)

If you want early access before release, please contact support@caret.team.

## Relationship with Existing API Keys

Even after Caret Provider is released, the existing direct API key input method will continue to be supported. You can have the following options:

**Using Caret Provider**: Easy start, integrated management, free credit utilization

**Using Direct API Keys**: Leverage existing accounts, more model choices, direct cost management

It's also possible to use both methods together.
