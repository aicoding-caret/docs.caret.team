# <BrandName /> Provider

<BrandName /> Provider is an integrated authentication system that lets you use an AI coding assistant immediately without an API key. It is available now.

## What is it?

The first barrier many developers face when using <BrandName /> for the first time is API key setup. The process of obtaining API keys from AI providers like OpenAI or Anthropic, registering payment information, and managing usage can be cumbersome.

<BrandName /> Provider removes this initial entry barrier. With just a <BrandName /> account, you can immediately use the AI assistant without separate API key configuration.

## Google Gemini Priority Support

The first supported model for <BrandName /> Provider is **Google Gemini**. Gemini offers powerful coding capabilities while being relatively affordable, making it suitable for beginners and individual developers.

## Free Credits

All users who use <BrandName /> Provider for the first time receive **free credits**. This lets you test <BrandName />'s features without real cost burden.

## Image Generation Tool (<BrandName /> Account)

When you sign in with a <BrandName /> account, you can use the image generation tool. It is authenticated with the <BrandName /> token, and outputs are automatically saved in your workspace.

### How it works

1. Ask <BrandName /> to generate an image (e.g., "Create an illustration for a dashboard").
2. <BrandName /> calls the image generation API and produces the result.
3. Output files are saved under `.agents/generated-assets/` in your workspace.

### Storage rules

Each request creates two files using the request ID:

- `.agents/generated-assets/<request_id>.<ext>`: the image file
- `.agents/generated-assets/<request_id>.md`: metadata (prompt and image link)

### Reference images

Besides text prompts, you can attach images when requesting generation. You can specify **a particular image as a reference** to keep **consistent style, composition, or character identity** while iterating or editing images.  
If you do not specify a reference image, the tool can automatically use the selected image scope or other default input behavior.

### Practical tips

- Decide as a team whether generated images and metadata should be committed to the repo.
- Prompts are stored in the `.md` file, so avoid sensitive information.
- You can instruct <BrandName /> to move generated assets into **specific project folders** for organized management.
- This enables **document-driven prompt management and resource editing**, letting you manage worldbuilding or character guides alongside prompts to produce content or service assets.

## Future Plans

After Gemini support, we plan to add other AI models sequentially so they can be used through <BrandName /> Provider.

## Updates

We will share new features and changes through the following channels:

- Notifications within <BrandName /> VS Code extension
- [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/K3mU3EEvWm)
- Official website (https://careti.ai)

## Relationship with Existing API Keys

Even after <BrandName /> Provider is released, the existing direct API key input method will continue to be supported. You can have the following options:

**Using <BrandName /> Provider**: Easy start, integrated management, free credit utilization (Gemini first, with ChatGPT, Claude, and local providers like Naver/Upstage added sequentially)

**Using Direct API Keys**: Leverage existing accounts, more model choices, direct cost management

It's also possible to use both methods together.
