# Caret Provider

Caret Provider is an integrated authentication system that lets you use an AI coding assistant immediately without an API key. It is available now.

## What is it?

The first barrier many developers face when using Caret for the first time is API key setup. The process of obtaining API keys from AI providers like OpenAI or Anthropic, registering payment information, and managing usage can be cumbersome.

Caret Provider removes this initial entry barrier. With just a Caret account, you can immediately use the AI assistant without separate API key configuration.

## Google Gemini Priority Support

The first supported model for Caret Provider is **Google Gemini**. Gemini offers powerful coding capabilities while being relatively affordable, making it suitable for beginners and individual developers.

## Free Credits

All users who use Caret Provider for the first time receive **free credits**. This lets you test Caret's features without real cost burden.

## Image Generation Tool (Caret Account)

When you sign in with a Caret account, you can use the image generation tool. It is authenticated with the Caret token, and outputs are automatically saved in your workspace.

### How it works

1. Ask Caret to generate an image (e.g., "Create an illustration for a dashboard").
2. Caret calls the image generation API and produces the result.
3. Output files are saved under `.agents/generated-assets/` in your workspace.

### Storage rules

Each request creates two files using the request ID:

- `.agents/generated-assets/<request_id>.<ext>`: the image file
- `.agents/generated-assets/<request_id>.md`: metadata (prompt and image link)

### Reference images

Besides text prompts, you can attach images when requesting generation. You can specify **a particular image as a reference** to keep **consistent style, composition, or character identity** while iterating or editing images.  
If you do not specify a reference image, the tool can automatically use the selected image scope or other default input behavior.

### Practical tips

- Decide as a team whether generated images and metadata should be committed to the repo.
- Prompts are stored in the `.md` file, so avoid sensitive information.
- You can instruct Caret to move generated assets into **specific project folders** for organized management.
- This enables **document-driven prompt management and resource editing**, letting you manage worldbuilding or character guides alongside prompts to produce content or service assets.

## Future Plans

After Gemini support, we plan to add other AI models sequentially so they can be used through Caret Provider.

## Updates

We will share new features and changes through the following channels:

- Notifications within Caret VS Code extension
- [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/K3mU3EEvWm)
- Official website (https://caret.team)

## Relationship with Existing API Keys

Even after Caret Provider is released, the existing direct API key input method will continue to be supported. You can have the following options:

**Using Caret Provider**: Easy start, integrated management, free credit utilization (Gemini first, with ChatGPT, Claude, and local providers like Naver/Upstage added sequentially)

**Using Direct API Keys**: Leverage existing accounts, more model choices, direct cost management

It's also possible to use both methods together.
