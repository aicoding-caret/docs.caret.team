# Dual Mode System

Careti keeps Cline’s Plan/Act workflow intact while adding its own **Chatbot/Agent** experience. Pick the mode that fits how much autonomy and control you want.

## How it works

- **Agent mode (Careti)**: Full autonomy. Reads/writes files and runs commands, but you can interrupt and ask questions at any time. Think “pair programmer that can keep coding after you clarify something.”
- **Chatbot mode (Careti)**: Guidance-only. Reads/searches/answers questions; writing and command execution are blocked by default so you stay in the driver’s seat.
- **Plan/Act mode (Cline)**: Original two-step flow. Plan asks for approval, Act executes until you stop it.
- **Terminology swap**: In Careti mode you see Chatbot/Agent labels; switching to Cline mode shows the familiar Plan/Act terms and behavior.

## Prompt system & safety rails

- **JSON-driven prompts**: Careti assembles system prompts per mode, so tone and guidance match Chatbot vs Agent.
- **Tool limits by mode**: Agent can use all tools. Chatbot is read/search/ask-only; write/execute is blocked to prevent unintended edits.
- **Switch anytime**: Change modes in settings; behavior and labels update immediately.
