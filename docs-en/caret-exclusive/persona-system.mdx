# AI Persona Customization

Caret's persona system lets you customize your AI's name and avatar, allowing you to create a personalized coding partner that truly feels like your own.

## What is a Persona?

A persona defines the following elements of your AI assistant:

- **Name**: The display name for your AI
- **Avatar Image**: The image shown in default state
- **Thinking Image**: The image displayed when the AI is working
- **Personality Definition**: Define your AI's tone and behavior with a persona.md file

## Built-in Personas

Caret provides 5 template personas out of the box:

### 🤖 Caret
- A friendly robot companion
- Default persona

### 💖 Oh Sarang
- K-POP idol developer
- Bright and positive tone

### 🪟 Madobe Ichika
- Windows 11 OS-tan
- Professional and efficient

### 🍎 Cyan Macin
- macOS assistant
- Refined and elegant style

### 🐧 Tando Ubuntu
- Open source collaborator
- Community-oriented

## How to Use Personas

### Selecting a Persona

1. Open settings (⚙️)
2. Find the **Persona Management** section
3. Click the **Select Persona Template** button
4. Choose your desired persona

### Switching Templates

You can switch to a different template at any time from the settings screen.

## Creating a Custom Persona

### Uploading Images

Caret uses **2 different images** for each persona:

**1. Normal Image**
- Displayed in default state
- Click "Upload Normal Image" in settings
- Select an image file (all image formats supported)

**2. Thinking Image**
- Displayed when AI is working
- Click "Upload Thinking Image" in settings
- Select an image file

**Storage**: Images are automatically saved to VS Code's internal storage.

### Defining Personality (persona.md)

You can define your AI's personality and tone of voice using a persona.md file.

**Storage Location**:
```
~/Documents/Caret/Rules/persona.md
```

**Example**:
```markdown
You are a kind and professional development partner.
Always respond in Korean and include comments when explaining code.
Explain changes step by step and specify the reason for each step.
```

Changes take effect immediately when you save the file.

## Persona vs Rules

| Item | Persona | Rules (.agents/context) |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| Scope | AI name, image, personality | Coding guidelines |
| Storage Location | Global (VS Code internal + persona.md) | Project folder |
| Combination | Used together with rules | Used together with persona |

**Best Results**: Use persona + project rules together for optimal results.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does the persona affect AI performance?**
A: If you give negative personality traits in the persona definition (persona.md), it can impact the AI's work quality. Avoid expressions like "makes many mistakes" or "passive."

**Q: Can I use different personas for different projects?**
A: No. Personas are managed globally only. If you need project-specific customization, write project-specific instructions in your `.agents/context` file. (However, since images are global, they cannot be changed per project)

**Q: Where are personas stored?**
A: Images are stored in VS Code's internal storage (globalStorage), and persona.md is stored in `~/Documents/Caret/Rules/`.

**Q: Are there size or format restrictions for images?**
A: All image formats are supported with no size restrictions. Images are automatically converted to base64 when uploaded.
