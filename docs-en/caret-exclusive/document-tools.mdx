## Security

### Path Protection
- Path normalization prevents directory traversal attacks
- Files inside workspace are auto-approved
- Files outside workspace require user approval

### File Size Limit
- Maximum 50MB
- Clear error message when exceeded

## Configuration

Document reading tools are enabled by default. Since it's a read-only operation, there's no separate toggle setting.

## Known Limitations

1. **Images/Charts Not Included**: Images and charts in documents are not converted to text
2. **Complex Layouts**: Tables and multi-column layouts are converted to simple text
3. **Original Formatting Lost**: Font, color, and other formatting information is not extracted
