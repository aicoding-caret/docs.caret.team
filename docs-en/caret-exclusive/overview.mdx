### 🚀 Provider Setup Automation (Related Feature)

When selecting an AI model, manually searching for available models can be tedious. Caret automates this process through integration with the LiteLLM API.

**Automatic Model Lookup**: When you select a provider, all AI models supported by that provider are automatically displayed. Choose OpenAI and you'll instantly see GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and other available models. Select Anthropic and the Claude series appears.

**Real-time Updates**: By fetching the latest model information from the LiteLLM API in real-time, new AI models automatically appear in the list as they're released—no Caret update required.

**Extensive Support**: Supports **over 100 AI providers** including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini. Easily use models from diverse providers like Cohere, AI21 Labs, and Hugging Face.

**Korean AI Company Partnership**: Caret collaborates with Korean AI companies to support more providers. If you want to leverage AI models specialized for the Korean language, you'll soon be able to configure them easily in Caret.

Thanks to this automation, developers can quickly select their desired AI model and start coding without complex configuration steps.
