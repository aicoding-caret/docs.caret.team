# Agent Standardization (AAIF SoT)

Caret uses a single, standard rules path: `.agents/context/`. Legacy rule paths are not supported.

## Standard Rule Sources

- Workspace rules: `.agents/context/`
- Scoped instructions: `AGENTS.md` (recursive)
- Global rules: Documents/Caret/Rules
- Workflows: `.agents/context/workflows/` (on-demand)

## Why This Change

- Prevents duplicate prompt loading
- Eliminates rule conflicts
- Keeps the rules system deterministic

## Initialization

- If the standard layout is missing, `/init` creates the scaffold.
- Existing files are never overwritten.

## Migration

Move any legacy rule files/directories into `.agents/context/`.
