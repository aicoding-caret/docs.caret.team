Building good workflows requires the right balance of **clear instructions**, **modularity**, and **tool usage**. Use the tips below as a guide.

## Building Workflows with Careti

Careti understands your project context, making it a great partner for workflow design.

### A Workflow to Create Workflows

Workflow authoring is easier than it looks--and you can even use a workflow to create one.

First, save the [create-new-workflow.md](https://github.com/cline/prompts/blob/main/workflows/create-new-workflow.md) file in your workspace (for example, `.agents/context/workflows/`).

Then run `/create-new-workflow.md` and Careti will guide you through:

1. Asking for the purpose and a short name
2. Describing goals and expected outcomes
3. Organizing key steps
4. Generating a structured workflow file

<Tip>
  **Automate your work logs:** Finished tasks are great workflow candidates. After you complete a task, ask "Turn what I just did into a workflow," and Careti will analyze the conversation and generate a workflow file.
</Tip>

Store project-specific workflows in `.agents/context/workflows/` and global workflows in `~/Documents/Careti/Workflows/`. If there is a name conflict, project workflows take precedence.

## Workflow Design

<Tip>
  **Start small:** Begin with a single-task workflow and expand once you're comfortable.
</Tip>

### Modularity

Smaller, reusable workflows are easier to maintain and debug than a single large one.

### Clear Comments

As with code, explaining **why** matters. Good comments help both Careti and your team understand intent.

### Version Control

Keep workflows in `.agents/context/workflows/` and commit them to Git. This makes versioning and team sharing easier.

## Prompt Design for Careti

### Be Specific About Tool Usage

Rather than saying "find the file," specify the tool and location.

* **Bad:** "Find the user controller"
* **Good:** "Use `search_files` to find `UserController` under `src/controllers`"

## Advanced Techniques

### Common Tools

Here are some of the tools commonly used inside workflows:

#### execute_command
Run terminal commands (tests, builds, git, etc.)

```xml
<execute_command>
  <command>npm run test</command>
  <requires_approval>false</requires_approval>
</execute_command>
```

#### read_file
Read files (code/config analysis)

```xml
<read_file>
  <path>src/config.json</path>
</read_file>
```

#### search_files
Search across the codebase

```xml
<search_files>
  <path>src/</path>
  <query>UserController</query>
</search_files>
```

### Tool Choice Matters

Different tools return different levels of detail. Choose the most efficient tool for the task.

- **For whole file reads**: use `read_file`
- **For quickly finding keywords**: use `search_files`
- **For full directory listings**: use `list_files`

### Use Structure

Structured workflows are easier for Careti to follow. Use sections like:

- **Purpose**
- **Inputs**
- **Steps**
- **Constraints**
- **Output format**

### Example Workflow Format

```markdown
# Workflow Name

## Purpose
Describe what the workflow does.

## Inputs
- What information or variables are needed?

## Steps
1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Keep steps small and actionable

## Constraints
- Rules, limits, or safety checks

## Output format
- What the assistant should return
```

Following these practices will help you build workflows that are reliable, reusable, and easy to maintain.
