In this tutorial, you'll create a workflow that automates GitHub Pull Request reviews. It shows how to combine CLI tools, file analysis, and user interaction.

### Prerequisites

* Careti installed
* [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated
* A Git repository with a PR to test

## Create a PR Review Workflow

This workflow fetches PR info, analyzes changes, and drafts review comments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the workflow file">
    Create a project-specific workflow directory.

    1. Create `.agents/context/workflows` in the project root
    2. Create `pr-review.md` inside that folder
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write the workflow content">
    Add the content below to `pr-review.md`.

    ````markdown pr-review.md
    # Pull Request Reviewer

    This workflow helps me review a pull request by analyzing the changes and drafting a review.

    ## 1. Gather PR Information
    First, I need to understand what this PR is about. I'll fetch the title, description, and list of changed files.

    ```bash
    gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json title,body,files
    ```

    ## 2. Examine Modified Files
    Now I will examine the diff to understand the specific code changes.

    ```bash
    gh pr diff PR_NUMBER
    ```

    ## 3. Analyze Changes
    I will analyze the code changes for:
    *   **Bugs:** Logic errors or edge cases.
    *   **Performance:** Inefficient loops or operations.
    *   **Security:** Vulnerabilities or unsafe practices.

    ## 4. Confirm Assessment
    Based on my analysis, I will present my findings and ask how you want to proceed.

    ```xml
    <ask_followup_question>
      <question>I've reviewed PR #PR_NUMBER. Here is my assessment:

    [Insert Analysis Here]

    Do you want me to approve this PR, request changes, or just leave a comment?</question>
      <options>["Approve", "Request Changes", "Comment", "Do nothing"]</options>
    </ask_followup_question>
    ```

    ## 5. Execute Review
    Finally, I will execute the review command based on your decision.

    ```bash
    # If approving:
    gh pr review PR_NUMBER --approve --body "Looks good to me! [Summary of analysis]"

    # If requesting changes:
    gh pr review PR_NUMBER --request-changes --body "Please address the following: [Issues list]"

    # If commenting:
    gh pr review PR_NUMBER --comment --body "[Comments]"
    ```
    ````

    <Note>
      When running this workflow, replace `PR_NUMBER` with the actual PR number (e.g., `/pr-review.md 123`).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the workflow">
    Now you're ready to run it.

    1. Open the Careti chat panel
    2. Type `/pr-review.md` followed by the PR number (e.g., `/pr-review.md 42`)
    3. Careti fetches PR details, analyzes the code, and shows findings

    <Tip>
      When Careti runs commands like `gh pr view`, it may pause to show output. Click **Proceed While Running** to let Careti continue.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Other Common Use Cases

This is just a starting point. You can build workflows for many tasks, such as:

* **Creating components:** Generate boilerplate for new files (React components, API endpoints)
* **Running tests:** Run a test suite and summarize results
* **Deployment automation:** Use tools like `docker` and `kubectl`
* **Guided refactors:** Step through complex refactors

Look for repetitive tasks in your workflow and turn them into efficient Careti workflows.
