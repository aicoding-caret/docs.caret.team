### What are Editor Integrations?

Editor integrations are commands and shortcuts that let you use <BrandName /> right where you're working. Instead of switching to the <BrandName /> panel first, you can select code, right-click, and immediately send it to <BrandName /> for help.
These integrations appear in different places throughout VSCode:

-   In the editor context menu (right-click menu) - "Add to <BrandName />"
-   In the terminal context menu - "Add to <BrandName />"
-   In the Source Control view - "Generate Commit Message"
-   As keyboard shortcuts - Various <BrandName /> commands
-   As Quick Fix options (lightbulb menu) - "Fix with <BrandName />", "Explain with <BrandName />", "Improve with <BrandName />"

### Available Editor Integrations

<BrandName /> offers several editor integrations, each designed to enhance different aspects of your development workflow:

### How They Work

When you use these commands, <BrandName />:

-   Captures the relevant context (selected code, file path, terminal output, etc.)
-   Focuses the <BrandName /> interface
-   Creates a conversation with the captured context
-   In some cases, automatically generates a suggested prompt

Behind the scenes, these commands use VSCode's extension API to register commands, access editor state, and control VSCode's interface.
