<BrandName />'s code commands bring AI assistance directly into your editor, letting you interact with your code without leaving your workflow. With a simple right-click, you can add code to <BrandName />, and through the lightbulb menu, you can fix errors, get explanations, or improve your code.

## Available Code Commands

When you interact with code in your editor, you can access <BrandName /> commands in two ways:

### Right-Click Context Menu

When you right-click on selected code, you'll see:

</Frame>

#### Add to <BrandName />

The "Add to <BrandName />" command sends your selected code to the <BrandName /> chat panel. This is perfect for:

-   Asking questions about specific code snippets
-   Requesting improvements or optimizations
-   Getting explanations of complex logic

When you use this command, <BrandName /> automatically includes:

-   The file path (as a file mention)
-   The selected code with proper formatting
-   The programming language for accurate syntax highlighting

### Lightbulb Menu (Code Actions)

When you see a lightbulb icon in your editor, click it to access these <BrandName /> commands:

#### Fix with <BrandName />

The "Fix with <BrandName />" command appears in the lightbulb menu when your code has errors or warnings. This command:

1. Captures the selected code
2. Identifies the errors or warnings from VSCode's diagnostics
3. Sends both to <BrandName /> with a request to fix the issues
4. Provides a solution that addresses the specific problems

This is incredibly useful for quickly resolving syntax errors, linter warnings, or type issues without having to manually describe the problem.

#### Explain with <BrandName />

The "Explain with <BrandName />" command helps you understand complex code. When you select code and use this command from the lightbulb menu, <BrandName />:

1. Analyzes the selected code
2. Provides a clear explanation of what the code does
3. Breaks down complex logic into understandable parts
4. Highlights important patterns or techniques used

#### Improve with <BrandName />

The "Improve with <BrandName />" command helps you enhance your code. When you select code and use this command from the lightbulb menu, <BrandName />:

1. Analyzes the selected code for potential improvements
2. Suggests optimizations, refactorings, or better practices
3. Explains the reasoning behind the suggested changes
4. Provides improved code that maintains the original functionality

## How to Use Code Commands

Using <BrandName />'s code commands is simple:

### For Right-Click Commands:

1. Select the code you want to work with
2. Right-click to open the context menu
3. Choose "Add to <BrandName />"
4. View the result in the <BrandName /> chat panel

### For Lightbulb Menu Commands:

1. Select the code you want to work with
2. Look for the lightbulb icon that appears in the editor gutter
3. Click the lightbulb to see available actions
4. Choose the appropriate <BrandName /> command (Fix, Explain, or Improve)
5. View the result in the <BrandName /> chat panel

After using any command, you can:

-   Ask follow-up questions
-   Request modifications to the solution
-   Apply the changes back to your code

## How It Works Under the Hood

When you use a code command, here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **Code Selection**: The extension captures your selected code and its context
2. **Metadata Collection**: <BrandName /> gathers important metadata:

    - File path and name
    - Programming language
    - Any associated diagnostics (errors/warnings)
    - Surrounding code context when relevant

3. **Command Processing**:

    - For "Add to <BrandName />," the code is formatted and sent to the chat panel
    - For "Fix with <BrandName />," the code and diagnostics are analyzed and a fix is generated
    - For "Explain with <BrandName />," the code is analyzed to provide a clear explanation
    - For "Improve with <BrandName />," the code is analyzed for potential optimizations and improvements

4. **Integration with Chat**: The results appear in the <BrandName /> chat panel, where you can:
    - See the AI's response
    - Ask follow-up questions
    - Apply suggested changes

This seamless integration between your editor and <BrandName />'s AI capabilities makes it easy to get assistance without disrupting your coding flow.

## Tips for Effective Use

-   **Select complete logical units**: When possible, select entire functions, classes, or modules to give <BrandName /> complete context
-   **Include imports**: For language-specific help, include relevant imports so <BrandName /> understands dependencies
-   **Combine with @ mentions**: For complex issues, use code commands along with file or problem mentions for more context
-   **Use keyboard shortcuts**: Speed up your workflow by [assigning keyboard shortcuts](/en/features/commands-and-shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts) to common code commands

Next time you're struggling with a piece of code, try using <BrandName />'s code commands instead of switching to a separate chat interface. You'll be amazed at how much more efficient your workflow becomes when AI assistance is integrated directly into your editor.
