The Auto Approve menu lets you set fine-grained permissions on what you allow Caret to do in an automated way.

## How it works

By default, Caret will ask for your permission before calling any tool, including reading or writing files.

If you want to allow Caret to do something without asking, you can set the Auto Approve permission for that tool.

## Permission Options

-   **Read project files**

    -   Allows Caret to read files within your current workspace without asking
    -   **Read all files**
        -   Extends read permission to files outside your workspace (system files, config files, etc.)

-   **Edit project files**

    -   Allows Caret to modify files within your current workspace without confirmation
    -   **Edit all files**
        -   Extends modification permission to files outside your workspace

-   **Execute safe commands**

    -   Allows execution of terminal commands that the model deems non-destructive
    -   **Execute all commands**
        -   Permits execution of any terminal command without asking

-   **Use the browser**

    -   Allows Caret to use the browser tool to fetch web content

-   **Use MCP servers**

    -   Permits connection to and usage of MCP servers for extended functionality

-   **Maximum requests**
    -   Sets the number of consecutive automated actions Caret can take before requiring your input

## Best Practices

Suggested starting defaults for most workflows:

-   Auto-approving read access to project files
-   Setting a reasonable maximum request limit (10-20)

This gives Caret room to explore without constant prompts while still requiring approval for edits or destructive actions.

Adjust permissions to fit the situation: tighten for production, relax for prototyping. Use the quick “star” actions to toggle auto-approved items on or off as needed.
