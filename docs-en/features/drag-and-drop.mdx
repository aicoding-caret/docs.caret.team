<Note>Due to VS Code quirks, to drag and drop files into the <BrandName /> chat input, you need to hold `Shift` while dragging.</Note>

Dragging and dropping workspace files into <BrandName /> will automatically create a [file mention](/en/features/at-mentions/file-mentions). This allows you to reference the file in your conversation without needing to type out the path.

### Dragging from Finder/File Explorer

You can drag files directly from your system's file manager into <BrandName />:
