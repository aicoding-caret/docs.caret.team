The Claude Code provider lets you use your existing Claude subscription with Caret. If you have Claude Max or Pro, this means you can use Claude in Caret without paying extra API costs.

## Setup

First, you'll need to install and authenticate Claude Code on your system:

1. **Install Claude Code**: Follow Anthropic's [official setup guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup) to install and authenticate the Claude CLI.

2. **Configure in Caret**:
    - Open Caret settings (⚙️ icon)
    - Select **Claude Code** from the **API Provider** dropdown
    - Set the path to your Claude CLI executable (usually just `claude` if it's in your PATH)

### Finding your Claude Code path

-   **macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash**: `which claude`
-   **Windows Command Prompt**: `where claude`

## Supported Models

The Claude Code provider supports these models:

-   `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (Recommended)
-   `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`
-   `claude-opus-4-20250514`
-   `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
-   `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
-   `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`

## How it works

When you use Claude Code with Caret, here's what happens behind the scenes:

Caret wraps the Claude Code CLI to handle your requests. Each time you send a message, Caret starts a new `claude` process, sends your conversation, and streams the response back. The AI reasoning comes from Claude Code, but all the actual file editing, terminal commands, and other tools are handled by Caret.

The main difference you'll notice is that responses don't stream character-by-character like other providers. Instead, Claude Code processes your full request before sending back the complete response.

## Limitations

There are a few things to keep in mind with Claude Code:

-   Images in your messages get converted to text placeholders since Claude Code doesn't support image uploads through the CLI
-   Prompt caching isn't available with this provider
-   Responses don't stream in real-time like other providers

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:

**Authentication problems**: Make sure you're logged into Claude Code with your subscription account. Run `claude auth status` to check.

**Path issues**: Double-check that the Claude CLI path in Caret's settings is correct. Try running `claude --version` in your terminal to verify it's working.

**Still having trouble?** We're actively improving this integration. Report issues on our [GitHub](https://github.com/caret/caret/issues) or ask for help in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/caret).

## Usage with subscriptions

If you have a Claude Max subscription, your usage in Caret shows up as $0.00 in the billing interface since you're not paying additional API costs. Your usage still counts against your subscription limits, but you won't see per-token charges.
