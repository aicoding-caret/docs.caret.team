<Note>
캐럿(Caret) 기준 문서입니다. Caret v3.38.1 머지본을 따르며, 캐럿 전용 정책(지원/차단 모델, 지역/계정 제한, 인증/라우팅)이 있을 경우 본문에서 `<Note>`로 표시합니다.
</Note>

<Note>
Provider Setup 강화: `caret-docs/features/f09-enhanced-provider-setup.md`에 따라 캐럿은 프로바이더 설정 검증/UX가 강화될 수 있습니다. 계정/조직 정책 또는 캐럿 라우터 적용 시 허용/차단 모델이 달라질 수 있음을 안내하세요.
</Note>

Caret supports accessing models directly through the official OpenAI API.

**Website:** [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/)

### Getting an API Key

1.  **Sign Up/Sign In:** Visit the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/). You'll need to create an account or sign in if you already have one.
2.  **Navigate to API Keys:** Once logged in, go to the [API keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) of your account.
3.  **Create a Key:** Click on "Create new secret key". It's good practice to give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Caret API Key").
4.  **Copy the Key:** **Crucial:** Copy the generated API key immediately. For security reasons, OpenAI will not show it to you again. Store this key in a safe and secure location.

### Configuration in Caret

2.  **Select Provider:** Choose "OpenAI" from the "API Provider" dropdown menu.
3.  **Enter API Key:** Paste your OpenAI API key into the "OpenAI API Key" field.
4.  **Select Model:** Choose your desired model from the "Model" dropdown list.
5.  **(Optional) Base URL:** If you need to use a proxy or a custom base URL for the OpenAI API, you can enter it here. Most users will not need to change this from the default.

### Tips and Notes

-   **Pricing:** Be sure to review the [OpenAI Pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing) for detailed information on the costs associated with different models.
-   **Azure OpenAI Service:** If you are looking to use the Azure OpenAI service, please note that specific documentation for Azure OpenAI with Caret may be found separately, or you might need to configure it as an OpenAI-compatible endpoint if such functionality is supported by Caret for custom configurations.
