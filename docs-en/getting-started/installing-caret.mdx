### VS Code Marketplace: Step-by-Step Setup

Follow these steps to get Caret up and running:

1.  **Open VS Code:** Launch the VS Code application.

    > **Note:** If VS Code shows "Running extensions might...", click "Allow".

2.  **Open Your Caret Folder:** In VS Code, open the Caret folder you created in Documents.
3.  **Navigate to Extensions:** Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code (`Ctrl + Shift + X` or `Cmd + Shift + X`).
4.  **Search for 'Caret':** In the Extensions search bar, type `Caret`.

1. **Install the Extension:** Click the "Install" button next to the Caret extension.
2. **Open Caret:**
    - Click the Caret icon in the Activity Bar.
    - Or, use the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`) and type "Caret: Open In New Tab" for a better view.
3. **Troubleshooting:** If you don't see the Caret icon, try restarting VS Code.

> **Pro Tip:** You should see the Caret chat window appear in your VS Code editor!

1. Open your editor.
2. Access the Extensions view.
3. Search for "Caret".
4. Select "Caret" by saoudrizwan and click **Install**.
5. Reload if prompted.
