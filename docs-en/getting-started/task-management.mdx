# Task Management

As you use <BrandName />, you'll accumulate many tasks over time. The task management system helps you organize, filter, search, and clean up task history so your workspace stays efficient.

## Accessing Task History

You can open task history in two ways:

1.  Click the **History** button in the <BrandName /> sidebar
2.  Use the Command Palette and search for **"<BrandName />: Show Task History"**

## Task History Features

The task history view includes several powerful tools.

### Search and Filtering

-   **Search bar**: Use fuzzy search at the top to quickly find tasks by content.
-   **Sort options**: Sort tasks by:
    -   Most recent (default)
    -   Oldest
    -   Most expensive (highest API cost)
    -   Most tokens (highest token usage)
    -   Most relevant (when searching)
-   **Favorites filter**: Toggle to show only favorited tasks.

### Task Actions

Each task in the history view supports these actions:

-   **Open**: Click a task to reopen it in <BrandName /> chat.
-   **Favorite**: Click the star icon to mark a task as a favorite.
-   **Delete**: Remove an individual task (favorites are protected).
-   **Export**: Export the conversation as Markdown.

## Favoriting Tasks

Favorites help you keep important tasks easy to find and preserve.

### How Favorites Work

-   **Toggle favorite**: Click the star icon next to any task.
-   **Protection**: Favorited tasks are protected from individual and bulk deletion (can be overridden).
-   **Filtering**: Use the favorites filter to quickly access important tasks.

## Bulk Actions

The task history view supports multiple bulk actions.

-   **Multi-select**: Use checkboxes to select multiple tasks.
-   **Select all / Deselect all**: Quickly select or clear selections.
-   **Delete selected**: Remove all selected tasks.
-   **Delete all**: Remove all tasks in history (favorites are kept unless explicitly included).

## Best Practices

1.  **Favorite important tasks**: Mark reference tasks or frequently accessed conversations.
2.  **Clean up regularly**: Remove old or unused tasks to improve performance.
3.  **Use search**: Leverage fuzzy search to find specific conversations quickly.
4.  **Export valuable tasks**: Save important tasks as Markdown for external reference.

Task management helps you maintain an organized workflow in <BrandName />--quickly find past conversations, preserve important tasks, and keep your history clean and efficient.
