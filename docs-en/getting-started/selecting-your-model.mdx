캐러티(Careti) 기준 문서입니다. Careti v3.38.1 머지본을 따르며, 캐러티 전용 정책(지원/차단 모델, 지역 제한, 인증/라우팅)이 있을 경우 본문에서 `<Note>`로 표시합니다.

Careti needs an AI model to understand your requests and write code. Think of it like choosing which expert to work with - different models have different strengths and costs.

## Quick Start: Choose Your Provider

The easiest way to get started is with **Careti** as your provider:

1. **Open Careti Settings**: Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner of Careti's chat
2. **Select "Careti"** from the API Provider dropdown
3. **Choose a model** from the dropdown - we recommend starting with **Claude Sonnet 4.5** or **DeepSeek V3**

**That's it!** No API keys to manage, and you'll get access to multiple models.

<Tip>
**Free models available**: Careti occasionally offers free inferencing through partner providers. When available, you'll see these options in your model dropdown.
</Tip>

## Alternative: Use Another Provider

If you prefer to use your own API keys, you can select from providers like:

- **OpenRouter** - Great value, multiple models
- **Anthropic** - Direct access to Claude models  
- **OpenAI** - Access to GPT models
- **Google Gemini** - Google's AI models
- **Ollama** - Run models locally on your computer

After selecting a provider, you'll need to:
1. Get an API key from their website
2. Paste it into the API Key field in Careti settings
3. Choose your model

<Note>
Most providers require payment information before generating API keys.

## Which Model Should I Choose?

If you're just getting started, we recommend:

| Your Priority | Choose This Model | Why |
|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Reliability** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Most reliable for coding tasks |
| **Value** | DeepSeek V3 | Great performance at low cost |
| **Speed** | Qwen3 Coder | Fast responses |
| **Privacy** | Any Ollama model | Runs on your computer |

You can switch models anytime without losing your conversation.

## Next Steps

With your model configured, you're all set! In the next section, we'll walk you through completing your first task with Careti and show you how to interact with the AI to write, debug, and refactor code.
