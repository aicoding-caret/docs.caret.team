> **Tip:** If coding is completely new to you, take each step slowly. There's no need to rush--Cline will guide you.

### Getting Started

Before you begin coding, prepare the following essentials.

#### 1. **VS Code**

A popular, free, and powerful code editor.

-   [<u>Download VS Code</u>](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Recommended YouTube tutorial:** [<u>How to install VS Code</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlIzFUI1QGA)

> **Pro tip:** Install VS Code in your Applications folder (macOS) or Program Files (Windows) so it's easy to access from the Dock or Start menu.

#### 2. **Project Organization**

Create a dedicated `Caret` folder inside your Documents folder for all coding projects.

-   **macOS:** `/Users/[Your Name]/Documents/Caret`
-   **Windows:** `C:\Users\[Your Name]\Documents\Caret`

Organize projects clearly inside the `Caret` folder.

-   `Documents/Caret/workout-app` _(e.g., a fitness tracker app)_
-   `Documents/Caret/portfolio-website` _(e.g., a portfolio site)_

> **Tip:** Organizing from the start saves time and confusion later.

#### 3. **Install the Caret VS Code Extension**

Install the Caret extension directly inside VS Code to enhance your workflow.
