# Careti Context System (Memory Bank Replacement)

Careti **fully replaces** the Cline Memory Bank approach.  
Instead, Careti manages project context through **`AGENTS.md` + `.agents/context` + `caret-docs` + `work-logs`**.

## Quick Start

1. **Run `/init` to scaffold**  
   It generates the baseline `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/context` structure.
2. **Read the mandatory docs before work**  
   Check `AGENTS.md` → `.agents/context/caret-rules.json`.
3. **Load workflows on demand**  
   Only pull the specific workflows you need from `.agents/context/workflows/`.
4. **Keep docs and logs updated**  
   Record changes in `caret-docs/` and `work-logs/`.

## Core Components

| Component | Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Entry/meta rules | load order, language, prohibitions |
| `.agents/context` | AI rules SoT | workflows + atoms |
| `.agents/context/workflows` | On-demand workflows | load only when needed |
| `caret-docs/` | Developer documentation | 1:1 parity with AI rules |
| `work-logs/` | Progress & decisions | submodule, `.work-logs/` planned |

## Why Careti Replaced Memory Bank (Careti Advantages)

- **AAIF international standard**: rule paths and loading are standardized.  
- **On-demand rule loading**: only the necessary docs are read.  
- **AI/Developer knowledge parity**: both see the exact same docs.  
- **Separated progress logs**: status/decisions live in `work-logs/`.

## Legacy Memory Bank Mapping

| Memory Bank | Careti Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `projectbrief.md` | `caret-docs/development/index.md` + overview specs |
| `productContext.md` | `caret-docs/features.en/**` |
| `systemPatterns.md` | `.agents/context/workflows/atoms/**` + architecture docs |
| `techContext.md` | `caret-docs/development/**` |
| `activeContext.md`/`progress.md` | `work-logs/**` (master/sub logs) |

> **Important**: Do not use a `memory-bank/` folder. Migrate existing files to the paths above.

## Working Flow

### Plan Mode
1. Read `AGENTS.md` → `.agents/context/caret-rules.json`.
2. Load only the workflows you need.
3. Check `caret-docs/` for specs and guidance.
4. Share a plan document before execution.

### Act Mode
1. Load only the required rules/workflows.
2. Implement the changes.
3. Record updates in `caret-docs/` and `work-logs/`.

## Update Rules

- **Rule/process changes** → update `.agents/context` + `caret-docs/` together
- **Feature/requirement changes** → update `caret-docs/features.en/**`
- **Progress/decisions** → record in `work-logs/**`
- **Security** → never store secrets/tokens in docs
